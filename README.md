Depending on what file you run at first, a specific body will be produced, all with a matching navigation bar at the top. The navigation bar contains my name along with a link to the portfolio page, the contact page, and an about page as well.

The contact page has a field for user to input their Name, followed by Email, Message, and lastly a submit button. The About Me page contains an image along with 2 paragraphs of personal information. The Portfolio page has 6 pictures depicting hobbies + projects
